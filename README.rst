Channels augments Django to bring WebSocket, long-poll HTTP,
task offloading and other async support to your code, using familiar Django
design patterns and a flexible underlying framework that lets you not only
customize behaviours but also write support for your own protocols and needs.

Documentation, installation and getting started instructions are at
https://channels.readthedocs.io
