Full release notes, with more details and upgrade information, are available at:
https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/releases

4.3.0 (2025-07-28)
------------------

* Updated asgiref dependency to v3.9+.

* Dropped support for EOL Python and Django versions. Python 3.9 is now the
  minimum supported version.

* Fixed compatibility of ``ChannelsLiveServerTestCase`` with Django 5.2.

* Fixed DB setup for spawned testing subprocess, typically on Windows and macOS.

See the `Version 4.3.0 release notes
<https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/releases/4.3.0.html>`_ for more
details.

4.2.2 (2025-03-30)
------------------

* Added fallbacks for old valid channel/group name checks.

  These were renamed in 4.2.1 but (as internal methods) without deprecation.
  They are restored (and deprecated) here to allow updating channel layers
  using them.

4.2.1 (2025-03-29)
------------------

Channels 4.2.1 primarily updates the metadata for supported Python and Django
versions.

* Added official support for Django 5.2 LTS.

* Added official support for Python 3.13.

* Added a warning for the length of the channel layer group names.

See also the `Version 4.2.1 release notes
<https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/releases/4.2.1.html>`_ in the docs.

4.2.0 (2024-11-15)
------------------

Channels 4.2 introduces a couple of major but backwards-compatible
changes, including most notably enhanced async suppport and fixing
a long-standing bug where tests would try and close db connections
and erroneously fail.

There are a number of other small bugfixes. Please ensure to review the
`Version 4.2.0 release notes
<https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/releases/4.2.0.html>`_ for full
details.

4.1.0 (2024-04-03)
------------------

Channels 4.1 is maintenance release in the 4.x series.

The main change is an update in the required Python and Django version.
Python 3.8, and Django 4.2 are now the minimum required versions.

There are a number of other small bugfixes. Please ensure to review the
`Version 4.1.0 release notes
<https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/releases/4.1.0.html>`_ for full
details.

4.0.0 (2022-10-15)
------------------

Channels 4 is the next major version of the Channels package. Together with the
matching Daphne v4 and channels-redis v4 releases, it updates dependencies,
fixes issues, and removes outdated code. It so provides the foundation for
Channels development going forward.

In most cases, you can update now by updating ``channels``, ``daphne``, and
``channels-redis`` as appropriate, with ``pip``, and by adding ``daphne`` at
the top of your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting.

First ``pip``::

    pip install -U 'channels[daphne]' channels-redis

Then in your Django settings file::

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        "daphne",
        ...
    ]

Again, this is a major version change. Amongst other changes, large amounts of
the Django-wrapping code deprecated in Channels v3 has now been removed, in
favour of Django's own ASGI handling, and the ``runserver`` command has been
moved into the Daphne package.

Please ensure to review the `Version 4.0.0 release notes
<https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/releases/4.0.0.html>`_ for full
details.

3.0.5 (2022-06-24)
------------------

Channels 3.0.5 is a bugfix release in the 3.0 series.

Please see the `Version 3.0.5 release notes
<https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/releases/3.0.5.html>`_ for full
details.


3.0.4 (2021-07-11)
------------------

Channels 3.0.4 is a bugfix release in the 3.0 series.

Please see the `Version 3.0.4 release notes
<https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/releases/3.0.4.html>`_ for full
details.


3.0.3 (2020-12-28)
------------------

* Fixed a bug in Channels 3.0 where the legacy ``channels.http.AsgiHandler``
  would not correctly isolate per-request scopes.

  This is a security release for CVE-2020-35681. Please see the `Version 3.0.3
  release notes
  <https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/releases/3.0.3.html>`_ for full
  details.


3.0.2 (2020-11-9)
-----------------

* Fixes a bug in Channels 3.0 where ``StaticFilesWrapper`` was not updated to
  the ASGI 3 single-callable interface.

* Users of the ``runworker`` command should ensure to update ``asgiref`` to
  version 3.3.1 or later.


3.0.1 (2020-11-4)
-----------------

* Fixes a bug in Channels 3.0 where ``SessionMiddleware`` would not correctly
  isolate per-instance scopes.


3.0.0 (2020-10-30)
------------------

Updated to ASGI v3, and added support for Django 3.0+.

This is a major version change requiring updates to consumers and middleware.
Please see the full `Version 3.0.0 release notes
<https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/releases/3.0.0.html>`_ for details.


2.4.0 (2019-12-18)
------------------

* Wraps session save calls in ``database_sync_to_async()``, for compatibility
  with Django 3.0's ``async_unsafe()`` checks.

* Drops compatibility with all Django versions lower than 2.2.


2.3.1 (2019-10-23)
------------------

* Adds compatibility with Python 3.8.


2.3.0 (2019-09-18)
------------------

* Adjusted ``AsgiHandler`` HTTP body handling to use a spooled temporary file,
  rather than reading the whole request body into memory.

  As a result, ``AsgiRequest.__init__()`` is adjusted to expect a file-like
  ``stream``, rather than the whole ``body`` as bytes. Test cases instantiating
  requests directly will likely need to be updated to wrap the provided body
  in, e.g., `io.BytesIO`.


2.2.0 (2019-04-14)
------------------

* Updated requirements for ASGI v3 and Daphne 2.3.


2.1.7 (2019-01-31)
------------------

* HTTP request body size limit is now enforced

* database_sync_to_async now closes old connections before it runs code

* Auth middleware closes old connections before it runs


2.1.6 (2018-12-08)
------------------

* HttpCommunicator now extracts query strings correctly

* AsyncHttpConsumer provides channel layer attributes

* Prevent late-Daphne import errors


2.1.5 (2018-10-22)
------------------

* Django middleware caching now works on Django 1.11 and Django 2.0.
  The previous release only ran on 2.1.


2.1.4 (2018-10-19)
------------------

* Django middleware is now cached rather than instantiated per request
  resulting in a significant speed improvement

* ChannelServerLiveTestCase now serves static files again

* Improved error message resulting from bad Origin headers

* runserver logging now goes through the Django logging framework

* Generic consumers can now have non-default channel layers

* Improved error when accessing scope['user'] before it's ready


2.1.3 (2018-08-16)
------------------

* An ALLOWED_ORIGINS value of "*" will now also allow requests without a Host
  header at all (especially important for tests)

* The request.path value is now correct in cases when a server has SCRIPT_NAME
  set

* Errors that happen inside channel listeners inside a runworker or Worker
  class are now raised rather than suppressed


2.1.2 (2018-06-13)
------------------

* AsyncHttpConsumer now has a disconnect() method you can override

* Session and authentication middleware is now non-blocking.

* URL routing context now includes default arguments from the URLconf.

* The FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME setting is now respected in ASGI mode.

* ALLOWED_HOSTS is now set correctly during LiveServerTests.


2.1.1 (2018-04-18)
------------------

* The scope["user"] object is no longer a lazy object, as this conflicts with
  any async-based consumers.


2.1.0 (2018-04-11)
------------------

* Async HTTP Consumers and WebSocket Consumers both gained new functionality
  (groups, subprotocols, and an async HTTP variant)

* URLRouters now allow nesting

* Async login and logout functions for sessions

* Expiry and groups in the in-memory channel layer

* Improved Live Server test case

* More powerful OriginValidator

* Other small changes and fixes in the full release notes.


2.0.2 (2018-02-08)
------------------

* SyncConsumer now terminates old database connections, and there is a new
  database_sync_to_async wrapper to allow async connections to do the same.


2.0.1 (2018-02-05)
------------------

* AsyncWebsocketConsumer and AsyncJsonWebsocketConsumer classes added

* OriginValidator and AllowedHostsOriginValidator ASGI middleware is now available

* URLRouter now correctly resolves long lists of URLs


2.0.0 (2018-02-01)
------------------

* Major backwards-incompatible rewrite to move to an asyncio base and remove
  the requirement to transport data over the network, as well as overhauled
  generic consumers, test helpers, routing and more.


1.1.6 (2017-06-28)
------------------

* The ``runserver`` ``server_cls`` override no longer fails with more modern
  Django versions that pass an ``ipv6`` parameter.


1.1.5 (2017-06-16)
------------------

* Workers in threading mode now respond to ctrl-C and gracefully exit.

* ``request.meta['QUERY_STRING']`` is now correctly encoded at all times.

* Test client improvements

* ``ChannelServerLiveTestCase`` added, allows an equivalent of the Django
  ``LiveTestCase``.

* Decorator added to check ``Origin`` headers (``allowed_hosts_only``)

* New ``TEST_CONFIG`` setting in ``CHANNEL_LAYERS`` that allows varying of
  the channel layer for tests (e.g. using a different Redis install)


1.1.3 (2017-04-05)
------------------

* ``enforce_ordering`` now works correctly with the new-style process-specific
  channels

* ASGI channel layer versions are now explicitly checked for version compatibility


1.1.2 (2017-04-01)
------------------

* Session name hash changed to SHA-1 to satisfy FIPS-140-2. Due to this,
  please force all WebSockets to reconnect after the upgrade.

* `scheme` key in ASGI-HTTP messages now translates into `request.is_secure()`
  correctly.

* WebsocketBridge now exposes the underlying WebSocket as `.socket`


1.1.1 (2017-03-19)
------------------

* Fixed JS packaging issue


1.1.0 (2017-03-18)
------------------

* Channels now includes a JavaScript wrapper that wraps reconnection and
  multiplexing for you on the client side.

* Test classes have been moved from ``channels.tests`` to ``channels.test``.

* Bindings now support non-integer fields for primary keys on models.

* The ``enforce_ordering`` decorator no longer suffers a race condition where
  it would drop messages under high load.

* ``runserver`` no longer errors if the ``staticfiles`` app is not enabled in Django.


1.0.3 (2017-02-01)
------------------

* Database connections are no longer force-closed after each test is run.

* Channel sessions are not re-saved if they're empty even if they're marked as
  modified, allowing logout to work correctly.

* WebsocketDemultiplexer now correctly does sessions for the second/third/etc.
  connect and disconnect handlers.

* Request reading timeouts now correctly return 408 rather than erroring out.

* The ``rundelay`` delay server now only polls the database once per second,
  and this interval is configurable with the ``--sleep`` option.


1.0.2 (2017-01-12)
------------------

* Websockets can now be closed from anywhere using the new ``WebsocketCloseException``.
  There is also a generic ``ChannelSocketException`` so you can do custom behaviours.

* Calling ``Channel.send`` or ``Group.send`` from outside a consumer context
  (i.e. in tests or management commands) will once again send the message immediately.

* The base implementation of databinding now correctly only calls ``group_names(instance)``,
  as documented.


1.0.1 (2017-01-09)
------------------

* WebSocket generic views now accept connections by default in their connect
  handler for better backwards compatibility.


1.0.0 (2017-01-08)
------------------

* BREAKING CHANGE: WebSockets must now be explicitly accepted or denied.
  See https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/releases/1.0.0.html for more.

* BREAKING CHANGE: Demultiplexers have been overhauled to directly dispatch
  messages rather than using channels to new consumers. Consult the docs on
  generic consumers for more: https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generics.html

* BREAKING CHANGE: Databinding now operates from implicit group membership,
  where your code just has to say what groups would be used and Channels will
  work out if it's a creation, modification or removal from a client's
  perspective, including with permissions.

* Delay protocol server ships with Channels providing a specification on how
  to delay jobs until later and a reference implementation.

* Serializers can now specify fields as `__all__` to auto-include all fields.

* Various other small fixes.

0.17.3 (2016-10-12)
-------------------

* channel_session now also rehydrates the http session with an option

* request.META['PATH_INFO'] is now present

* runserver shows Daphne log messages

* runserver --nothreading only starts a single worker thread

-------------------

* New CHANNELS_WS_PROTOCOLS setting if you want Daphne to accept certain
  subprotocols

* WebsocketBindingWithMembers allows serialization of non-fields on instances

* Class-based consumers have an .as_route() method that lets you skip using
  route_class

* Bindings now work if loaded after app ready state


0.17.1 (2016-07-22)
-------------------

* Bindings now require that `fields` is defined on the class body so all fields
  are not sent by default. To restore old behaviour, set it to ['__all__']

* Bindings can now be declared after app.ready() has been called and still work.

* Binding payloads now include the model name as `appname.modelname`.

* A worker_ready signal now gets triggered when `runworker` starts consuming
  messages. It does not fire from within `runserver`.


0.17.0 (2016-07-19)
-------------------

* Data Binding framework is added, which allows easy tying of model changes
  to WebSockets (and other protocols) and vice-versa.

* Standardised WebSocket/JSON multiplexing introduced

  line with the ASGI rules on WebSocket backpressure.

* You no longer need to call super's setUp in ChannelTestCase.


0.15.1 (2016-06-29)
-------------------

* Class based consumers now have a self.kwargs

* Fixed bug where empty streaming responses did not send headers or status code


0.15.0 (2016-06-22)
