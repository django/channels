4.3.0 Release Notes
===================

Channels 4.3 is a maintenance release in the 4.x series.

Bugfixes & Small Changes
------------------------

* Updated asgiref dependency to v3.9+.

  The ``ApplicationCommunicator`` testing utility will now return its result if
  the application is finished when sending input. Assert the
  ``CancelledError``` rather than allowing a timeout in your tests if you're
  affected by this change.

  minimum supported version.

* Fixed compatibility of ``ChannelsLiveServerTestCase`` with Django 5.2.

* Fixed DB setup for spawned testing subprocess, typically on Windows and macOS.
