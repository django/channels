4.2.2 Release Notes
===================

Channels 4.2.2 is a bugfix release in the 4.2 series.

Bugfixes & Small Changes
------------------------

* Added fallbacks for old valid channel/group name checks.

  These (internal) methods were renamed in v4.2.1 without deprecation. This
  release adds (deprecated) fallback aliases to allow time for channel layers
  to update.
